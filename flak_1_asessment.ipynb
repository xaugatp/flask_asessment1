View functions are responsible for generating a response (e.g., rendering HTML, returning JSON) when a particular URL is accessed.\\n\\nModularity: Routes contribute to the modularity of the application. Different sections of the application can be handled by separate view functions, making the codebase organized and maintainable.\\n\\nDynamic URLs: Flask supports dynamic URLs by allowing route parameters. For example, @app.route('/user/<username>') defines a route with a dynamic parameter, and the corresponding view function can access the value of username from the URL.\\n\\nRESTful APIs: When building RESTful APIs, routes play a crucial role in defining endpoints for different resources (e.g., GET /users, POST /create, etc.).\\n\\nClean Code Structure: App routes contribute to a clean and understandable code structure.
